## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("datacamp/funneljoin")
```

## Example

## Rules 
- If type_x is "last" or "first", then a right join has the same number of rows as y.
- If type_y is "last", "first", or "firstafter", then a left join has the same number of rows as x. 

## Types of joins
* first-first: You can take earliest x and y for each user before the join (entered an experiment, then registered)
* first-firstafter: Take the first x, then the first y after that (entered an experiment, then started a course)
* lastbefore-firstafter: First x that's followed by a y before the next x (last click paid ad attribution)
* last-firstafter: Take the last X followed by the first Y afterward
* any-firstafter: All Xs followed by the first Y after it.
* any-any: All Xs followed by all Ys.

Gaps: 
* smallestgap: Smallest x-y gap (in tie, earliest).
* withingap: Gap is less than X (all ad clicks followed by a course start within an hour).
